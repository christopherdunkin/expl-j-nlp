This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook in which we explore various methods for processing Japanese text.

In addition to the standard packages NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and PyTorch, we also make use of Voyager (for nearest neighbour search), MeCab (for text segmentation), scikit-optimize (which we use for Bayesian optimisation), and llama-cpp-python (for local LLMs).
